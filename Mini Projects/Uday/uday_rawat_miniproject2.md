3. Brute force without a specific status code:gobuster dir -u https://hello.com/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -b 404
4. Brute force with custom user-agent: gobuster  dir -u http://10.10.63.233 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -a "Admin‚Äù
5. Brute force with a specified number of threads: gobuster  dir -u http://10.10.63.233 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -t 10
